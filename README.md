# Instructor install profile / distribution - compatible with Drupal 7

*__NOT YET READY FOR USE!  Testing purposes only at this time...__ - DanG, 20170108*

This is currently just a simple installation profile, created by copying the "standard" profile then modifying each file in minor ways to confirm everything works as expected.

I'll be making incremental changes over time with the goal of having, at the very least, a distribution I can use for sites I install and, ideally, a full-fledged project anyone can grab and use immediately.

To use it, download the repo and place it into your <drupal-root>/profiles/ directory, then install as you normally would (browser, drush, etc.).  It is set to be the default profile and automatically select English as the install language.

__@todo - add information on the profile's / distribution's intended use.__
